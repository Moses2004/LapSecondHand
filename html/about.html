    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to LAP Second Hand Phone Service! Our mission is to create a secure, trustworthy, and transparent marketplace for second-hand phones in Myanmar.
        In an era where new phones are increasingly expensive, we established this platform to help you easily buy high-quality pre-owned phones at affordable prices, or confidently sell your used devices.

        We are committed to providing the best service to all our users. We build trust by transparently disclosing the condition of each phone and facilitating secure communication between buyers and sellers.
